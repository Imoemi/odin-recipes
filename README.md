My recipe page 
This project is about creating a recipe webpage 
I am going to create a recipe page on how to make toasted bread using a gas which is my go to breakfast on most days
By the time i am done with this project, i should have mastered how to use git and github which seem confusing at the moment.
I think I understand commit on git better right now.
i just added the image to my recipe page. i think i made as mistake when committing after i added the images. i already pushed main to my repository. i hope everything is okay.
I don't understand the chaining selectors lesson and i would skip it for now. casue is it fucking up my entire code
